Agent hierarchy
===============

Service		unique name
Interface	org.bluez.Agent
Object path	freely definable

Methods		void Release()

			This method gets called when the service daemon
			unregisters the agent. An agent can use it to do
			cleanup tasks. There is no need to unregister the
			agent, because when this method gets called it has
			already been unregistered.

		string RequestPasskey(object device)

			This method gets called when the service daemon
			needs to get the passkey for an authentication. The
			return value is actual passkey.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
			                 org.bluez.Error.Canceled

		void Authorize(object device, string uuid)

			This method gets called when the service daemon
			needs to authorize a connection/service request.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
			                 org.bluez.Error.Canceled

		void ConfirmModeChange(string mode)

			This method gets called if a mode change is requested
			that needs to be confirmed by the user. An example
			would be leaving flight mode.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
			                 org.bluez.Error.Canceled
