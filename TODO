Background
==========

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.  The complexity scale is exponential,
  with complexity 1 being the lowest complexity.  Complexity is a function
  of both task 'complexity' and task 'scope'.

  The general rule of thumb is that a complexity 1 task should take 1-2 weeks
  for a person very familiar with BlueZ codebase.  Higher complexity tasks
  require more time and have higher uncertainty.

  Higher complexity tasks should be refined into several lower complexity tasks
  once the task is better understood.


ATT/GATT
========

- Sample server shouldn't send any indications or notifications without
  the client requesting them

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Claudio Takahasi <claudio.takahasi@openbossa.org>

- gatttool should have the ability to wait for req responses before
  quitting (some servers require a small sleep even with cmd's). Maybe a
  --delay-exit or --timeout command line switch.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C1

- Long reads/writes don't work (consisting of multiple request packets)

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

- Add sdp discovery support to gattool with BR (--sdp, default is 0x1f)

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C1

- Add command line support to use medium instead of (default) low
  security level with gatttool (--sec-level)

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C1

- Add ATT/GATT parsing to hcidump

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2

- GATT server: fix MTU exchange

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2

- GATT server: fix read by UUID (read by handle works)

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2

- gatttool: add an interactive command prompt mode. Many LE devices
  expect the connection to stay up a long time and disable advertising
  after a disconnection so it's inconvenient to use gatttool in the
  current "single operation at a time" mode.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2
