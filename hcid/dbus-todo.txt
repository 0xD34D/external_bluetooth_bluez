* Get encryption key size
Date: 2006/04/11
Description: This method is not implemented

* record doesn't exist and not available
Date: 2006/04/11
Description: Review these errors. The usage of "Does not exists"
and "Not available" are confusing.

* pending HCI requests
Date: 2006/04/11
Description: The D-Bus authentication method creates automatically
an ACL connection when required and disconnects when the procedure
finishes. When the HCI connection complete arrives, remote name/
version/features are queued. Considering that the authentication
is not queued, when this procedure finishes and the disconnect is
requested, the remaining elements in the queue can't be executed.

* active connections verification
Date: 2006/04/11
Description: get_bdaddr function is called frequently in the
security.c file. In a real usage scenario, the disconnect
command can be sent by another process or BlueZ D-Bus method.
On this case if there is pending request confirmation(eg: remote
version complete or remote features complete), when the
confirmation arrives the bdaddr can't be retrieved because
there isn't active connection anymore. Suggestion: keep a active
connection list instead of call the get_bdaddr frequently. Keep
in mind that D-Bus data already has a list to store active
connections.
