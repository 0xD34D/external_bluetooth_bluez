* record doesn't exist and not available
Date: 2006/04/11
Description: Review these errors. The usage of "Does not exists"
and "Not available" are confusing.

* Authorization and services methods errors
Date: 2006/11/26
Define/review the errors for authorization and services methods

* D-Bus policies for Service Agents
Date: 2006/11/26
Define D-Bus policies to avoid clients call the service agent methods
directly.

* Resolve Name
Date: 2006/11/26
Re-design the name resolving to avoid adapter busy "state" with paging when
the remote device is not reachable.

* Service Agent path
Date: 2006/11/28
If a client sends a message to an invalid service agent path it is necessary
reply a standard message. eg: invalid service or service not registered
It is not correct register a fallback '/', maybe should be better filter the
message(use add_match) and check if the path belongs to the service list.
The manager path is a fallback path, but the service path can not include
'/org/bluez' prefix.

* Authorization path
AuthorizeService and CancelAuthorizationProcess are not compliant with the dbus-api.
Currently, only the messages sent to the manager path(base) "/org/bluez" are
accepted. Adapter paths must be handled too.
