* record doesn't exist and not available
Date: 2006/04/11
Description: Review these errors. The usage of "Does not exists"
and "Not available" are confusing.

* Resolve Name
Date: 2006/11/26
Re-design the name resolving to avoid adapter busy "state" with paging when
the remote device is not reachable.

* "void" in the D-Bus API has confuse meaning
Date: 2006/12/04
For some methods, "void" means that a method return without arguments is required.
However, "void" is being used to indicate that no reply is required. eg: 
org.bluez.PasskeyAgent.Cancel, org.bluez.AuthorizationAgent.Cancel,
org.bluez.AuthorizationAgent.Release

* Authorization requests cancel
Date: 2006/12/04
When stopping the adapter/unregistering the adapter D-Bus path pending
authorization requests must be cancelled.
