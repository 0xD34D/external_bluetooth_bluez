RFCOMM hierarchy (experimental)
===============================

Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.RFCOMM
Object path	/org/bluez/{hci0,hci1,...}

Methods		string Connect(string address, string service)

			This creates a connection to a remote RFCOMM based
			service. The service string can either be a UUID-128,
			a service abbreviation or a record handle.

			The return value will be the path of the newly
			created RFCOMM TTY device (for example /dev/rfcomm0).

			If the application disconnects from the D-Bus this
			connection will be terminated.

			Valid service values: "vcp", "map", "pbap", "sap",
			                      "ftp", "bpp", "bip", "synch",
			                      "dun", "opp", "fax", "spp"

		void CancelConnect(string address, string service)

			This method cancels a previous Connect method call.

		string ConnectByChannel(string address, byte channel)

			This creates a connection to a remote RFCOMM based
			service. In contrast to Connect a channel number is
			needed.

			The return value will be the path of the newly
			creates RFCOMM TTY device (for example /dev/rfcomm0).

			If the application disconnects from the D-Bus this
			connection will be terminated.

		void CancelConnectByChannel(string address, byte channel)

			This method cancels a previous ConnectByChannel
			method call.

		void Disconnect(string device)

			This will disconnect a previously connected RFCOMM
			service. The device parameter must be the return value
			from a previous Connect or ConnectByChannel method
			call (for example /dev/rfcomm0).

		string Bind(string address, string service)

		string BindByChannel(string address, byte channel)

		void Release(string device)

		array{string} ListBindings()
